# random-grid-NN-calib
a minimal working example from the paper "Deep calibration with random grids (2023) - F. Baschetti, G. Bormetti, P. Rossi". A sample Jupyter notebook explains how to train, hardcode and use feed-forward neural networks for calibration of the rough Heston model. 
Optimal neural network weigths are included as a .h5 file, training data available upon request (for rHeston and rBergomi, under different specifications of the forward variance curve). Do not run raw cells unless you asked for the data.
